                <p>Every release of this game has its own pros and cons, as well as its own price in the market. The prices that I am providing have been determined using PriceCharting.com, a website that finds the current market value of games by calculating the average price of the most recently sold listings of said games.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I will be providing the prices of the games in CIB (complete in box, meaning that the game has the case as well as any manuals or extras it was originally sold with) and loose (disc only, no case or extras) condition, the specs, release date (which will be for the North American region unless specified to be Worldwide), some miscellaneous information about factors that may affect the gameplay experience, and my overall rating of the version. These ratings can all be seen in the completed tierlist.</p>

                <p>
                    Starting off with the original release, the GameCube version is a solid option.
                    It was released in North America on January 11th, 2005, with a resolution of 480p and 30 FPS.
                    It has real-time rendered cutscenes and a progressive scan mode which allows a higher video output on modern monitors,
                    but this mode comes at a price: extremely visible dithering.
