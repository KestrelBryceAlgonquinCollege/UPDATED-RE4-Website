                <p>This page is dedicated to random bits of information I found while I was researching for this website that didn't fit in any of the other categories, as most of these aren't exclusive to one singular release.</p>

                <h2>Outdated currency</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The PTAS that you use to buy things from the Merchant are a real currency in Spain, but they were dropped in favor of the Euro in 2002, two years before this game takes place. Whether keeping the old currency was a conscious decision by Capcom to illustrate how isolated the inhabitants of the village are is unknown, but I personally think that the Merchant melts down all of coins you give him to sell the gold at an inflated price elsewhere.</p>

                <h2>Blatant misgendering (by accident???)</h2>
                <br>
                <p>As this game takes place in Spain and the ganados are spanish-speaking, all of their voicelines are in spanish, and they stay the same no matter which character you're playing as. This wouldn't seem like it would be a problem, but the enemy voicelines were designed for Leon, who is male. Since spanish is a gendered language, all of the voicelines are conjugated as if they are speaking to a male, which doesn't make sense when you're playing as Ashley or Ada. There are quite a few voice lines that fall under this gendered umbrella, but the most common ones are: "Mátalo!" (kill him) and "Cojelo, cojelo, cojelo..." (Get him, get him, get him...). The correct conjugation for these phrases would be: "Mátala!" (kill her) and "Cogela, cogela, cogela..." (Get her, get her, get her...).</p>
