                <h2>The Kennedy report</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Autumn, 2004. The President’s daughter, Ashley Graham, has been kidnapped and taken to a village in rural Spain. Leon Kennedy, a government agent held in very high regard by the president himself, is sent on a mission to save Ashley and bring her back to the United States by any means necessary.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, things take a turn for the worse when Leon discovers the reason behind the violent and inhuman nature of the villagers- they are part of a cult called the Los Illuminados, and they have infected themselves with a previously long extinct parasite known as the Las Plagas, which they have resurrected.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Leon and Ashley get infected by the villagers and must find a way to kill the parasites trying to take control of their bodies as well as cause a second extinction for the parasites, before they lose their minds to it entirely.</p>

                <h2>The journey begins...</h2>
                <br>
                <p>You play as Leon for the campaign’s duration, where you can use guns, your knife, and various throwable objects to eliminate enemies, but you cannot walk or strafe while doing so. There are several sections of the game where you must escort Ashley from one location to another, and during those sections, you must prevent the villagers from grabbing Ashley and bringing her to one of the level exits.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you stun or kill the enemy that has kidnapped Ashley, she will escape and run back to you. If you fail to save Ashley and the enemy successfully brings her to a level exit, a non-standard game over will be triggered, with the text “Mission Failed” instead of “You Are Dead” being displayed. The easiest way to prevent Ashley being kidnapped is to make her hide in a dumpster, which are spread around the levels. Dumpsters act as a safe zone for Ashley, as she cannot be attacked or kidnapped while inside one. She will only exit the dumpster when you give a command to her via whistling.</p>
